Building public is quite hot topic in twitterland and this is my take on it, sort of. I'm going to build this blog step by step and each step is documented here in this blog. This is the very first step which is completely copied from NextJS tutorial. In next post I'll start addinng new things to this frame like Tailwin CSS, DatoCMS, commenting, a contact form, my CV and maybe some of my photos also which is the other thing I'm passionate about.

Follow along, I hope you enjoy it!
